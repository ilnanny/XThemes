This folder contains the templates for new documents created in Inkscape. You will
normally see them listed in the File > New submenu. A template may store any
document-specific settings (such as initial zoom and view, paper size, background and
borders, metadata, window geometry, grid and guide settings, export hints) as well as
any objects. To add a new template, simply save or copy it in this folder; nothing else
is required.

Files of the mask default.*.svg are the translations of default.svg template into
different languages. The default.svg itself is in English. These translations contain
a translated name of the default layer and possibly different canvas size. Each
language version of Inkscape will only use one of these templates and ignore the rest.

Internationalization

This file is internationalized the same way as share/filters/filters/svg
The i18n.py script called from the makefile will extract strings from the *.svg
into a *.svg.h file. Intltool is then able to extracts these strings just like
from normal .h files.
